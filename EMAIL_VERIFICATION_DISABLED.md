# Email Verification Functionality - DISABLED

This document outlines what email verification functionality has been commented out from the Joborra codebase as requested.

## What Has Been Commented Out

### Backend (app/auth_api.py)

#### 1. Email Verification Endpoints
- **`/verify/request`** - Request email verification token
- **`/verify/confirm`** - Confirm email verification with token

#### 2. Email Verification State Management
- **`VERIFICATION_STATE`** variable - In-memory storage for verification tokens
- All related state management code

#### 3. Google OAuth Email Verification
- **`email_verified`** checks from Google OAuth responses
- **`is_verified`** field assignments based on Google verification status

#### 4. Email Templates and Sending
- Email verification email templates
- Email sending logic for verification

### Frontend

#### 1. App.tsx
- **`VerifyEmailPage`** import
- **`/verify-email`** route

#### 2. AuthPage.tsx
- Toast message: "Account created. Please verify your email to unlock all features"

#### 3. ProfilePage.tsx
- Email verification banner: "Verify your email to unlock all features"

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: All email verification endpoints and logic commented out  
✅ **Frontend**: All email verification UI elements commented out  
✅ **Compilation**: Both backend and frontend compile successfully  
✅ **Forgot Password**: Still fully functional (separate from email verification)

## What Still Works

- User registration and login
- Google OAuth authentication
- Forgot password functionality
- Password reset functionality
- All other authentication features

## How to Re-enable Later

To re-enable email verification functionality:

1. **Backend**: Remove comment markers (`#`) from email verification sections in `app/auth_api.py`
2. **Frontend**: Remove comment markers from email verification elements
3. **Routes**: Uncomment the `/verify-email` route in `App.tsx`
4. **UI**: Uncomment email verification messages and banners

## Notes

- The `is_verified` field in the database schema remains intact
- Users can still register and login without email verification
- All commented code is preserved and can be easily restored
- The forgot password system is completely independent and remains functional

---

**Status**: Email verification functionality has been successfully disabled while preserving all code for future re-enablement.
